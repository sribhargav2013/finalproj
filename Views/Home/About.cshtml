            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                Every year, millions of pets go missing. Some are lost, some are stolen, and some are abandoned. These pets often end up in shelters, where they may face euthanasia if they are not adopted.
                We were motivated to create this website to help reunite lost pets with their families and to find loving homes for adoptable pets. We believe that every pet deserves a loving home, and we are committed to doing everything we can to help them find one.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Team</h2>

                Adopting pets is crucial as it provides loving homes for animals in need, reduces overpopulation, and saves lives.
                It fosters companionship, promotes responsible pet ownership, and contributes to a compassionate society where animals are valued members of families.
